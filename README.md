## Basics
1. Set up a monogame repository.
2. Consider sprites for items, powerups, and player.

## Game Loop
Very basic, you jump on the wall. There is a floor. Your score goes up if you go up and down if you go down, and you have to jump on walls. You slide on the walls if you are on them while pressing the key towards them. You fall straight down otherwise. Powerups/ score modifiers are put in the middle of the walls to encourage wall jumping back and forth, there are also hazards that come down.
The walls are basic squares that go up almost infinitly. Level ups occur that make the game more challenging as you go up. If you die you get a score that tells you how far you've gone.
